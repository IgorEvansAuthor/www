 Little is known about the Igor Evans and most of it is false, starting with his absurd name. Even his website is an obvious placeholder.

 He is an enigma. No photographs exist because no camera can withstand the unbridled hostility of his gaze. Of his history, there is nothing to be said because there is none.

 There is no evidence that he has ever written anything before, nor even that he is literate. After all, the sole novel attributed to him reads suspiciously as though dictated by someone for whom English is not their primary language.

 There is, too, reason to question his English comprehension. Consider that the standard advice for aspiring authors is to write what you know. Instead, this weirdo wrote about a demigod who works as a private eye in a magical version of ancient Greece. Clearly, someone did not understand the assignment and now you get to suffer as a result.

 However, it is nobody’s fault other than your own if you read the book. And at least you can rest assured that there’s no more where it came from.
