  *Míklos* is a private eye with a private eye, a gift for self-mythology, and opinions so reactionary they’d make Spartans shift uncomfortably and excuse themselves.

  A deposed demigod, he perpetuates his unfulfilling, unending existence by cleaning up divine scandals in a noir Iron-Age Greece. Here, in an ancient and unchanging realm, human life is cheap, the gods terrifyingly real, and magic more menacing than magical.

  An unheroic protagonist and unreliable narrator, <i>Míklos</i> views the world through all three of his jaded eyes, filtering events through warped morals, thwarted ambitions, and a memory that refuses to let anything go. Moreover, despite having no sense of humor that he is aware of, he is disturbingly amusing.

  ***

  When a routine job to silence some embarrassing undead nearly gets *him* dead, *Míklos* stumbles upon a deception long woven by the gods themselves. His quest to unravel this mystery and avert its catastrophe takes him from the depths of the ocean floor to the peak of Mount *Ólympos.* Thus is he driven to uncover the secrets of Creation and forced to answer for his oldest sins.</p>

  Long mired in divinely ordained stagnation, he and his world are dragged forward at last, with consequences no witness saw coming and no survivor will ever forget.

  ***

  Take note: this novel is deliberate in its construction. The prose is elevated, ornate, and shaped by the cadences of classical oratory; the worldbuilding deep, cohesive, and historically grounded; the humor dry, bitter, and biting. This very text serves as sample.

  Voiced in the first person, it exudes the narrator’s affectations, egotism, and excessive love of Greek. Significantly, this foreign terminology is woven into the narrative and themes, though always transliterated and supported by a thorough—though thoroughly optional—glossary. Modern dialogue conventions are consciously eschewed.

  The tightly structured text invites and repays close attention, revealing its depth through layered themes, intricate plotting, and buried meanings. Its language is formal, its rhythms archaic, its mythology unapologetically dense. Italicized Greek words, complete with diacritics, are not uncommon. Yet despite its formal sensibilities, the pacing is brisk, the action plentiful, the comedy unmistakable.

  ***

  *Míklos’s* portrayal is unflinching and unflattering, though not entirely unsympathetic. He is a complex character whose profoundly alien moral views reflect his failings, not ideals to be emulated, nor flaws tidily redeemed.

  He philosophizes about mortality while squatting over corpses, justifies brutal violence with unassailable logic, and narrates supernatural combat with the casual detachment of a man filing paperwork.

  Though vain, pitiless, and deeply flawed besides, he remains perversely relatable: not because he is admirable, but because the spectacle of his slow-moving self-destruction is impossible to ignore.

  ***

  For those drawn to sophisticated storytelling, this tragicomedy offers rich rewards: a fully realized mythic world, a character study of immortal irrelevance, genuine emotional stakes behind the intellectualism, and dark humor beneath a looming apocalypse.

  Think Gene Wolfe’s unreliable narrators meet Roger Zelazny’s world-weary immortals, sharpened by Raymond Chandler’s hard-boiled detectives and shadowed by Homer's doomed epic heroes.

  ***

  This is a polished work with a voice of its own. It is not a joyful romp, not a modernized ironic retelling, and not volume one of an interminable series. Instead, it offers a singular experience forged from seemingly incompatible elements.

  If you appreciate literary fantasy that trusts the reader and offers more than escapism, this book was written with you in mind.

  **Come, step into the grin-dark world of <i>Míklos</i>. Just don’t expect him to be your hero.**
